### New Files (Improvements)

## Recommendation

**IMPORTANT**: These changes should be reviewed and committed before publication:

1. The deletions represent cleanup of redundant/obsolete files
2. The modifications fix bugs and update documentation
3. The new files provide comprehensive documentation

### Suggested Commit Strategy

1. **Commit cleanup separately**:
   ```bash
   git add -u  # Stage all deletions and modifications
   git commit -m "ðŸ§¹ Major cleanup and organization for publication readiness"
   ```

2. **Then commit new documentation**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/by_agents/
   git commit -m "ðŸ“š Add comprehensive agent documentation"
   ```

3. **Review any remaining changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

## Critical Files to Review
- `README.md` - Ensure all claims are accurate
- `CLAUDE.md` - Contains project guidelines
- Test files - All fixes have been verified

## Next Steps
1. Review changes with `git diff`
2. Commit changes as suggested above
3. Tag release version
4. Push to repository

The project is functionally complete, but these changes need to be committed to preserve the cleanup and improvements made during finalization.
