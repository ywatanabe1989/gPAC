# gPAC Project Status

## Implementation Status

### Speed ✅ VERIFIED
- **Achievement**: 166-180x faster than TensorPAC
- **Method**: GPU kernel timing (CUDA events)
- **Evidence**: `benchmarks/publication_evidence/cuda_profiling_test.py`
- **Reality**: Measures pure computation, excludes Python overhead

### Memory ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Claim**: "89x reduction through smart chunking"
- **Reality**: Full vectorization, no chunking implemented
- **Current**: Uses ~24GB for typical datasets
- **Code Status**: MemoryManager exists but NOT integrated

### Accuracy ✅ COMPARABLE
- **Peak Detection**: Both methods identify same frequencies
- **Correlation**: ~0.6-0.99 depending on parameters
- **Evidence**: 105 comprehensive tests passing

## Known Limitations

1. **Memory Requirements**
   - High GPU memory needed (~24GB)
   - No chunking despite claims
   - MemoryManager not integrated

2. **Speed vs Memory Trade-off**
   - Current: Fast but memory-hungry
   - Alternative: Slower but memory-efficient (not implemented)
   - Cannot achieve both simultaneously

3. **Performance Variability**
   - Small datasets: TensorPAC faster
   - Large datasets: gPAC faster
   - GPU overhead affects small operations

## Publication Readiness

### Ready ✅
- Core functionality working
- Speed improvements verified
- Test suite comprehensive

### Blocking Issues ❌
- Documentation claims don't match implementation
- Memory optimization claims are false
- Need to either fix code or fix claims

### Required Actions
**Option 1**: Integrate MemoryManager (2-3 days)
**Option 2**: Remove memory claims from docs (1 day)

## Bottom Line
gPAC achieves impressive speed (166-180x) through full GPU vectorization but at the cost of high memory usage. Memory optimization code exists but is not active. Scientific integrity requires fixing this discrepancy before publication.
