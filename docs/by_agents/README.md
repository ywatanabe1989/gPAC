# Agent-Generated Documentation Summary

This directory contains documentation created by AI agents during the gPAC project development and validation process.

## Key Document: CONSOLIDATED_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

**This file contains the complete, honest assessment of gPAC and replaces all other files in this directory.**

## What This Directory Contains

All files here document the discovery and correction of false performance claims, the validation of actual performance metrics, and the project cleanup process for publication readiness.

**Historical Context:**
- Multiple AI agents worked to validate and correct gPAC claims
- False memory optimization claims were discovered and removed  
- Actual performance was validated through evidence-based testing
- Project structure was cleaned for open source publication

## For New Users

Read only: **CONSOLIDATED_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**

All other files are historical records of the validation/cleanup process and contain redundant information.

## Evidence Scripts (Primary Validation)

The actual evidence for gPAC performance is in:
- `benchmarks/publication_evidence/cuda_profiling_test.py` - Speed validation
- `examples/gpac/example__PAC.py` - Accuracy validation  
- Multiple benchmark scripts confirming 160-180x speedup
