# Cleanup Opportunities for gPAC

## Summary
While the project is 100% ready for publication, there are optional cleanup opportunities to reduce repository size and improve cleanliness.

## 1. Python Cache Files
Found multiple `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files that can be safely removed:
- `./tests/.pytest_cache`
- Multiple `__pycache__` directories in tests/
- These are automatically regenerated when needed

**Command to clean**: 
```bash
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type d -name ".pytest_cache" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
```

## 2. Old Backup Directories
Found 20 `.old` directories containing previous versions:
- These were created during the cleanup process
- Safe to remove if no longer needed
- Total count: 20 directories

**Locations**:
- Root: `./.old`
- Source: `./src/gpac/.old`, `./src/gpac/_Filters/.old`
- Tests: `./tests/.old`, `./tests/gpac/.old`, etc.
- Examples: `./examples/.old`, nested `.old` directories
- Docs: `./docs/.old`, `./docs/by_agents/.old`

## 3. Large Archive (User Decision Required)
- `./archive/tensorpac/` - 126MB TensorPAC comparison code
- Not required for gPAC functionality
- Recommend removal to reduce repo size

## 4. Documentation Consolidation (Optional)
- 16 files in `./docs/by_agents/` with some overlap
- Could be consolidated to ~5 core documents
- Current files are well-organized but verbose

## Recommended Actions

### Essential Cleanup (Automated)
1. Remove Python cache files
2. Add comprehensive `.gitignore` to prevent future cache commits

### Optional Cleanup (User Decision)
1. Remove `.old` directories if backups no longer needed
2. Remove TensorPAC archive (saves 126MB)
3. Consolidate documentation files

### No Action Needed
- Source code: Clean and well-organized
- Tests: All passing and necessary
- Examples: All functional and demonstrative
- Core documentation: Accurate and complete

## Impact
- Current repository size: ~150MB+ (mainly due to archive)
- After cleanup: Could be reduced to ~20-30MB
- No impact on functionality

The project is ready for publication as-is, but these cleanups would make it more professional.
