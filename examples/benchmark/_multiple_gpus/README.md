# Multi-GPU Performance Testing Suite

A modular collection of performance tests for multi-GPU PAC analysis, addressing different aspects of parallel computing benefits.

## üéØ Visual Summary

  <img src="throughput_out/throughput_scaling.gif" alt="Multi-GPU Throughput Scaling" width="100%">
  
  **Key Result: Multi-GPU enables processing 4x larger datasets with high efficiency**
</div>

## üìä Test Modules

### `speed.py` - Computational Speed Test
**Purpose**: Measure speedup for identical workloads  
**Question**: "How much faster is multi-GPU for the same computation?"
```bash
python speed.py --n_perm 0
```
- Tests same data size on single vs multi-GPU
- Measures computational acceleration 
- Typical result: 1.2-1.8x speedup

### `vram.py` - VRAM Scaling Test  
**Purpose**: Test memory capacity scaling  
**Question**: "Can we process datasets that don't fit on single GPU?"
```bash
python vram.py --n_perm 0
```
- Finds maximum single GPU batch size
- Tests proportionally larger datasets on multi-GPU
- Demonstrates memory capacity benefits (measured in GB)

### `throughput.py` - Throughput Scaling Test ‚≠ê
**Purpose**: Process 4x more data efficiently (main value proposition)  
**Question**: "Can we process 4x larger datasets with reasonable throughput?"
```bash
python throughput.py --n_perm 0
```
- **Key insight**: Scale from single GPU to multiple GPUs processing 4x larger datasets
- Measures samples/second for larger datasets
- Shows real-world benefit: handle datasets impossible on single GPU

### `comodulogram.py` - Consistency Verification Test
**Purpose**: Verify computational consistency between single and multi-GPU  
**Question**: "Do we get identical results with multi-GPU processing?"
```bash
python comodulogram.py --batch_size 4 --pha_bands 20 --amp_bands 15 --n_perm 0
```
- Computes PAC comodulogram on identical data using both configurations
- Visualizes single GPU, multi-GPU, and difference plots
- Verifies correlation and numerical consistency (typical: r > 0.999)

## üõ†Ô∏è Shared Components

### `utils.py` - Common Utilities
- GPU memory monitoring (in GB)
- Data generation and configuration
- Performance measurement functions
- Visualization and reporting (DRY principle)

## üìà Key Insights

1. **Speed Test**: Measures computational efficiency (1.2-1.8x typical)
2. **VRAM Test**: Enables larger datasets than single GPU memory  
3. **Throughput Test**: ‚≠ê **Most meaningful** - process 4x more data efficiently
4. **Comodulogram Test**: Real-world research workflow demonstration

## üéØ Main Value Proposition

The **throughput test** demonstrates the key multi-GPU benefit:
- Single GPU: Limited by VRAM capacity
- Multi-GPU: Process 4x larger datasets with reasonable throughput
- **Conclusion**: Scale dataset size, not just computation speed

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Test computational speedup
python speed.py

# Test the main value proposition (recommended)
python throughput.py

# Test memory scaling capabilities  
python vram.py

# Test computational consistency
python comodulogram.py
```

## üìÅ Output Structure

Each test creates its own output directory:
- `speed_out/` - Speed test results and plots
- `vram_out/` - VRAM scaling results  
- `throughput_out/` - Throughput scaling results
- `comodulogram_out/` - Comodulogram analysis results

## üîß Requirements

- CUDA-capable GPUs (ideally 4+ for full testing)
- Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3` for multi-GPU testing
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- gPAC library with multi-GPU enabled
