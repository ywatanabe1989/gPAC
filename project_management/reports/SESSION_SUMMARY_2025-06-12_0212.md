# Session Summary - 2025-06-12

## Technical Consultation Session

### 1. PAC Frequency Band Analysis
**Issue**: User questioned whether 30 phase bands with overlapping boundaries were appropriate

**Analysis Completed**:
- Confirmed gPAC's bandwidth formulas match TensorPAC: 
  - Phase: bandwidth = center_freq / 2
  - Amplitude: bandwidth = center_freq / 4
- Identified literature recommendations:
  - Phase bands should be narrow (1-4 Hz)
  - Current f/2 formula may be too wide for higher frequencies

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Consider fewer bands (10-15) to reduce overlap
2. Use narrower bandwidths, especially for phase frequencies
3. Classic neuroscience bands or fixed Â±1 Hz widths may be more appropriate

### 2. README Image Optimization (Continued)
- Successfully redesigned with tiled layout
- Reduced vertical space by ~50%
- All images now display properly on GitHub

### 3. Repository Synchronization
- Merged develop branch into feature/paper branch
- Paper branch now includes all v0.2.1 fixes and improvements

## Current Project Status
- **Version**: v0.2.1 (released on PyPI)
- **Branch**: feature/paper (synchronized with develop)
- **Test Coverage**: 99.6%
- **Open Issues**: None
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date

## Technical Insights Gained
The session revealed that while gPAC correctly implements TensorPAC's bandwidth formulas, these formulas may not align with best practices from PAC literature, which recommends narrower phase bands for better phase resolution.
