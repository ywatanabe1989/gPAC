## Executive Summary

After fixing the critical caching bug, honest benchmarks reveal:
- **Simple configs (10×10 bands)**: gPAC is ~2x faster
- **Production configs (50×50 bands)**: gPAC is ~6x SLOWER
- Previous 100-1000x speedup claims were artifacts of incorrect caching

## Detailed Performance Results

### Small Band Configurations (10×10 bands, 20-50 permutations)

| Data Size | Duration | Channels | gPAC | TensorPAC | Speedup |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| 10K samples | - | 10 | 0.016s | 0.023s | 1.4x |
| 40K samples | - | 20 | 0.031s | 0.056s | 1.8x |
| 250K samples | - | 50 | 0.131s | 0.273s | 2.1x |
| 1M samples | - | 100 | 0.491s | 1.074s | 2.2x |
| 384K samples | 60s | 16 | 0.534s | 1.253s | 2.3x |

**Average: ~2x speedup**

### Production Configuration (50×50 bands, 200 permutations)

| Data Size | Duration | Channels | gPAC | TensorPAC | Speedup |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| 384K samples | 60s | 16 | 28.7s | ~5.0s | 0.17x |

**gPAC is 6x SLOWER in production settings**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why gPAC is slower with many frequency bands:

1. **Algorithmic complexity**: gPAC computes all 2,500 frequency pairs exhaustively
2. **Memory overhead**: Large tensor operations become inefficient
3. **GPU limitations**: Not all PAC operations parallelize well
4. **TensorPAC optimization**: CPU implementation likely uses algorithmic shortcuts

### When gPAC has advantages:

1. **Small frequency band counts** (≤20×20)
2. **Large batch processing** 
3. **Integration with GPU pipelines**
4. **Multi-GPU scaling** (not tested here)

## Caching Analysis

The caching mechanism provides no real-world benefit:
- Neural data is never identical between recordings
- 285x "speedup" for cached data is meaningless
- Adds complexity without practical value

## Recommendations

### 1. **Be Honest About Performance**
- Update documentation to reflect ~2x speedup for simple configs
- Acknowledge slower performance for production configs
- Remove inflated 100-1000x claims

### 2. **Optimize for Production Use Cases**
- Investigate why performance degrades with many bands
- Consider algorithmic optimizations like TensorPAC
- Profile memory usage patterns

### 3. **Remove or Minimize Caching**
- Disable by default
- Document as experimental feature only

### 4. **Focus Development on Real Advantages**
- Multi-GPU support
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration with deep learning pipelines
- Real-time processing scenarios

## Conclusion

gPAC provides modest but real performance improvements (~2x) for simple PAC analysis configurations. However, it becomes significantly slower than TensorPAC for production configurations with many frequency bands. The project has value but requires:

1. Honest performance claims
2. Algorithmic optimization for production use cases
3. Clear documentation about when to use gPAC vs TensorPAC

The ~30 second runtime mentioned in the production config file is accurate, but represents a scenario where gPAC is actually slower than the CPU alternative.
