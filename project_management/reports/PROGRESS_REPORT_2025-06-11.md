# Progress Report - 2025-06-11

## Summary
Created comprehensive SciTeX-Paper system for scientific manuscript management and began gPAC paper preparation.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. SciTeX-Paper System Development ✓
- Created reusable scientific paper management system in `scitex-paper/`
- Implemented "Code-with-Paper" philosophy with symlinked figures/tables
- Python-based build system replacing complex shell scripts
- Full LaTeX compilation pipeline with BibTeX support
- Version control and diff generation capabilities

### 2. Scientific Writing Guidelines Integration ✓
- Imported guidelines from `~/.claude/to_claude/guidelines/science/`
- Built comprehensive validation system for:
  - Abstract structure (7 sections, 150-250 words)
  - Introduction structure (8 required sections)
  - Statistical reporting completeness
  - Figure standards (axes labels, units, ranges)
  - Reference formatting and placeholders

### 3. Specialized Agent System ✓
- **AbstractAgent**: 7-section validation, word count checking
- **IntroductionAgent**: 8-section structure, logical flow validation  
- **LiteratureAgent**: Automated literature search, reference management
- **Base framework**: For creating additional section agents
- All agents designed for LLM-friendly interaction

### 4. gPAC Manuscript Setup ✓
- Created feature/paper branch for manuscript work
- Configured scitex.yaml with project details
- Linked analysis outputs via symlinks in paper/links/
- Set up manuscript structure with templates
- Updated abstract, keywords, and highlights sections

### 5. Documentation ✓
- Comprehensive README for SciTeX-Paper system
- Agent documentation with usage examples
- Updated bulletin board with system architecture details

## Key Achievements
1. **LLM-Friendly Design** - Clear Python commands and modular structure
2. **Reproducible Science** - Direct links to analysis outputs
3. **Best Practices Enforcement** - Automated validation of scientific standards
4. **Reusable System** - Can be used for any scientific paper project

## Technical Innovations
- Symlinked figures ensure manuscript always uses latest analysis results
- Validation agents catch common writing issues early
- Python-based system is more maintainable than shell scripts
- Modular design allows incremental improvements

## Next Steps
1. Write gPAC manuscript content using the templates
2. Generate figures from benchmark results  
3. Run validation checks on each section
4. Create bibliography from literature search
5. Package for journal submission

## Files Created/Modified
- `/scitex-paper/` - Complete reusable paper system
- `/scitex-paper/agents/` - Specialized writing agents
- `/paper/` - gPAC manuscript structure
- `/scitex.yaml` - Project configuration
- Multiple template files for sections
