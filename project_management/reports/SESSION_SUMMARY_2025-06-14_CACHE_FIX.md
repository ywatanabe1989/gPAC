## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Caching Bug
- **Issue**: Cache key was using `x.data_ptr()` (memory address) instead of tensor values
- **Solution**: Implemented `_create_cache_key()` using SHA256 hash of tensor values
- **Impact**: Correct caching behavior, preventing false cache hits/misses
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite verifying all caching scenarios

### 2. Conducted Honest Performance Evaluation
After fixing the caching bug, ran fair benchmarks comparing gPAC vs TensorPAC:

| Configuration | Frequency Bands | gPAC Performance |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Simple (10×10 bands) | 100 freq pairs | ~2x faster |
| Production (50×50 bands) | 2500 freq pairs | ~6x slower |

### 3. Discovered Additional Issues

#### Unfair Comparison in Parameter Sweep
- Parameter sweep benchmark uses `idpac=(2,0,0)` for TensorPAC
- This disables surrogate/permutation computation in TensorPAC
- gPAC computes permutations while TensorPAC does not
- Explains inflated speedup numbers (819x) in old benchmarks

#### Performance Scaling Issues
- gPAC performance degrades with many frequency bands
- Likely O(n²) algorithmic complexity
- TensorPAC appears to have optimizations for large band counts

## Key Insights

1. **Caching is largely irrelevant** for real neuroscience workflows
   - Neural data is never identical between recordings
   - 285x speedup for cached data is meaningless in practice

2. **True performance varies by use case**
   - gPAC excels with small-to-medium frequency band configurations
   - Performance advantage reverses for production configurations
   - Data reshaping adds overhead but isn't the main bottleneck

3. **Multiple factors inflated previous claims**
   - Caching bug (comparing memory addresses)
   - Unfair permutation comparison
   - Testing on favorable configurations only

## Recommendations

1. **Update parameter sweep benchmark** to use `idpac=(2,2,1)` for fair comparison
2. **Investigate algorithmic optimizations** for large frequency band counts
3. **Update documentation** with configuration-dependent performance guidance
4. **Consider disabling caching by default** as it adds complexity without real benefit

## Files Created
- Fixed caching implementation in `src/gpac/_PAC.py`
- Created `tests/gpac/test_caching_fix.py` 
- Various benchmark scripts in `benchmark/` (not committed)
- Performance reports in `project_management/reports/`

## Status
- Caching bug: ✓ Fixed and tested
- Performance evaluation: ✓ Complete
- Documentation: Needs updating with honest metrics
- Parameter sweep: Needs fixing for fair comparison
