   - Create tutorials and example notebooks
   - Set up documentation website

2. **Extended Benchmarks**
   - Test on additional GPU architectures
   - Benchmark with real-world datasets
   - Compare with other GPU-based implementations

#### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add support for additional PAC methods
   - Implement distributed computing support
   - Create GUI for non-programmers

2. **Integration**
   - Create plugins for popular neuroscience toolboxes
   - Develop cloud-based analysis service
   - Build containerized deployment options

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Project is stable with comprehensive tests
- **No Critical Issues**: Only minor environment-specific test failure
- **High Readiness**: Ready for community adoption

### Conclusion
The gPAC project has successfully achieved its primary goal of creating a fast, accurate, and user-friendly GPU-accelerated PAC analysis tool. With the manuscript complete and software published, the project is ready for scientific publication and community adoption.
