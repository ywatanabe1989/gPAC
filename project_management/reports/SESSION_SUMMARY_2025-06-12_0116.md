# Session Summary - 2025-06-12

## Overview
Maintenance session focused on README improvements and repository cleanup.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed README Image Visibility
- **Issue**: Images were not displaying on GitHub due to .gitignore blocking `*_out/` directories and `*.gif` files
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated .gitignore with specific exceptions for README image directories
  - Added only the images actually referenced in README (10 files total)
  - Maintained descriptive directory paths instead of generic "figures/"
  
### 2. Optimized Image Sizes
- Set appropriate widths for better display:
  - Main images: 800px
  - Correlation summary: 600px
  - Comparison pairs: 400px each
  - Legend: 200px

### 3. README Refinements
- Updated section title to "PAC Values Comparison with TensorPAC" for clarity
- Removed redundant comodulograms visualization to keep README concise

## Repository Status
- **Current Branch**: develop
- **Latest Version**: v0.2.1 (released to PyPI)
- **Test Coverage**: 99.6%
- **Open Issues**: None
- **Open PRs**: None

## Project Health
✅ Production-ready codebase  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  
✅ All images properly displaying on GitHub

The gPAC project continues to be in excellent shape for community use and adoption.
