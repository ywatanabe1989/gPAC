- **Critical Bug Fix**: Changed fp16 default from True to False
  - Prevents RuntimeError with mixed precision tensors
  - Added automatic float32 conversion for fp16 outputs
  - Ensures stable operation by default

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 25 new fp16/float32 tests
  - Coverage across all modules (PAC, BandPassFilter, Hilbert, ModulationIndex)
  - Verified high correlation (>0.99) between fp16 and float32 modes
  - All tests passing

- **Release Distribution**:
  - Published to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/gpu-pac/0.2.1/
  - Created GitHub release: https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/gPAC/releases/tag/v0.2.1
  - Updated CHANGELOG with proper version history
