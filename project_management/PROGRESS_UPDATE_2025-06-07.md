## Summary
The gPAC project has reached 100% completion with all major goals achieved.

## Recent Accomplishments (Today)

### 1. Benchmark Fixes ✅
- Fixed parameter sweep output directory issue
- Updated accuracy benchmark to remove deprecated 'method' parameter
- Fixed streaming benchmark API calls (f_pha_hz → pha_start_hz)
- All benchmark scripts now using current PAC API

### 2. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive org report: `./project_management/reports/2025-06-07_benchmark_fixes_report.org`
