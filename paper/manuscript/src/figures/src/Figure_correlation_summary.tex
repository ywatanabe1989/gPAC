\caption{Summary of correlation analysis between gPAC and TensorPAC across 16 synthetic datasets. 
(a) Scatter plot showing PAC value correlations for each dataset, with mean correlation of 0.785 ± 0.065 (mean ± SD). 
(b) Distribution of correlation coefficients demonstrating consistent agreement across diverse coupling parameters. 
The correlation below unity reflects different filter implementations (FIR vs Butterworth) rather than computational errors.}
