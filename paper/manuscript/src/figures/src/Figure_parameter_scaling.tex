\caption{Computational performance scaling of gPAC across key parameters. 
Each subplot shows speedup factor (GPU/CPU computation time) as a function of: 
(a) Batch size: Near-linear speedup up to 64 samples, plateauing due to memory bandwidth. 
(b) Number of channels: Super-linear speedup with increasing channel count. 
(c) Signal duration: Consistent acceleration across all time scales. 
(d) Sampling frequency: Minimal impact on relative performance. 
(e) Phase frequency bands: Efficient parallelization across frequency space. 
(f) Amplitude frequency bands: Similar scaling to phase bands. 
(g) Number of permutations: Linear scaling maintains real-time capability. 
(h) Chunk size: Optimal performance at intermediate chunk sizes. 
Shaded regions indicate standard deviation across 5 runs.}
