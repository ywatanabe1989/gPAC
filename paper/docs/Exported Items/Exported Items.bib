	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback–Leibler distance—a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions—and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

	abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the modulation index and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding how the phase and amplitude of distinct neural oscillations might interact to support dynamic communication within the brain. In particular, previous work has demonstrated a coupling between the phase of low frequency oscillations and the amplitude (or power) of high frequency oscillations during certain tasks, termed phase amplitude coupling (PAC). For instance, during visual processing in humans, PAC has been reliably observed between ongoing alpha (8-13Hz) and gamma-band ({\textgreater}40Hz) activity. However, the application of PAC metrics to electrophysiological data can be challenging due to numerous methodological issues and lack of coherent approaches within the field. Therefore, in this article we outline the various analysis steps involved in detecting PAC, using an openly available MEG dataset from 16 participants performing an interactive visual task. Firstly, we localised gamma and alpha-band power using the Fieldtrip toolbox, and extracted time courses from area V1, defined using a multimodal parcellation scheme. These V1 responses were analysed for changes in alpha-gamma PAC, using four common algorithms. Results showed an increase in gamma (40-100Hz) - alpha (7-13Hz) PAC in response to the visual grating stimulus, though specific patterns of coupling were somewhat dependent upon the algorithm employed. Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed that these results were not driven by the presence of non-sinusoidal oscillations, and that trial length was sufficient to obtain reliable PAC estimates. Finally, throughout the article, methodological issues and practical guidelines for ongoing PAC research will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The amplitude of high broadband activity in human cortical field potentials indicates local processing and has repeatedly been shown to reflect motor control in the primary motor cortex. In a group of male and female subjects affected by essential tremor and undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery, ventral intermediate nucleus low-frequency oscillations ({\textless}30 Hz) entrain the corticomotor high broadband activity ({\textgreater}40 Hz) during rest, relinquishing that role during movement execution. This finding suggests that there is significant cross-rhythm communication between thalamocortical regions, and motor behavior corresponds to changes in thalamocortical phase-amplitude coupling profiles. Herein, we demonstrate that thalamocortical coupling is a crucial mechanism for gating motor behavior.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We demonstrate, for the first time, how thalamocortical coupling is mediating movement execution in humans. We show how the low-frequency oscillation from the ventral intermediate nucleus, known as the motor nucleus of the thalamus, entrains the excitability of the primary motor cortex, as reflected by the phase-amplitude coupling between the two regions. We show that thalamocortical phase-amplitude coupling is a manifestation of a gating mechanism for movement execution mediated by the thalamus. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating cross-frequency relationship in models of motor behavior; and given the spatial specificity of this mechanism, this work could be used to improve functional targeting during surgical implantations in subcortical regions.},

	abstract = {Infraslow activity (ISA) and high-frequency activity (HFA) are key biomarkers for studying epileptic seizures. We aimed to elucidate the relationship between ISA and HFA around seizure onset. We enrolled seven patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode placement. We comparatively analyzed the ISA, HFA, and ISA-HFA phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) or non-SOZ (nSOZ) in the interictal, preictal, and ictal states. We recorded 15 seizures. HFA and ISA were larger in the ictal states than in the interictal or preictal state. During seizures, the HFA and ISA of the SOZ were larger and occurred earlier than those of nSOZ. In the preictal state, the ISA-HFA PAC of the SOZ was larger than that of the interictal state, and it began increasing at approximately 87 s before the seizure onset. The receiver-operating characteristic curve revealed that the ISA-HFA PAC of the SOZ showed the highest discrimination performance in the preictal and interictal states, with an area under the curve of 0.926. This study demonstrated the novel insight that ISA-HFA PAC increases before the onset of seizures. Our findings indicate that ISA-HFA PAC could be a useful biomarker for discriminating between the preictal and interictal states.},

	abstract = {Low frequency brain rhythms facilitate communication across large spatial regions in the brain and high frequency rhythms are thought to signify local processing among nearby assemblies. A heavily investigated mode by which these low frequency and high frequency phenomenon interact is phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). This phenomenon has recently shown promise as a novel electrophysiologic biomarker, in a number of neurologic diseases including human epilepsy. In 17 medically refractory epilepsy patients undergoing phase-2 monitoring for the evaluation of surgical resection and in whom temporal depth electrodes were implanted, we investigated the electrophysiologic relationships of PAC in epileptogenic (seizure onset zone or SOZ) and non-epileptogenic tissue (non-SOZ). That this biomarker can differentiate seizure onset zone from non-seizure onset zone has been established with ictal and pre-ictal data, but less so with interictal data. Here we show that this biomarker can differentiate SOZ from non-SOZ interictally and is also a function of interictal epileptiform discharges. We also show a differential level of PAC in slow-wave-sleep relative to NREM1-2 and awake states. Lastly, we show AUROC evaluation of the localization of SOZ is optimal when utilizing beta or alpha phase onto high-gamma or ripple band. The results suggest an elevated PAC may reflect an electrophysiology-based biomarker for abnormal/epileptogenic brain regions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}EEG phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations modulated by the phase of low-frequency oscillations (LFOs), is a useful biomarker to localize epileptogenic tissue. It is commonly represented in a comodulogram of coupling strength but without coupled phase information. The phase-amplitude coupling is also found in the normal brain, and it is difficult to discriminate pathological phase-amplitude couplings from normal ones. This study proposes a novel approach based on complex-valued phase-amplitude coupling (CV-PAC) for classifying epileptic phase-amplitude coupling. The CV-PAC combines both the coupling strengths and the coupled phases of low-frequency oscillations. The complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) is then used to classify epileptic CV-PAC. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings from nine intractable epilepsy patients were analyzed. The leave-one-out cross-validation is performed, and the area-under-curve (AUC) value is used as the indicator of the performance of different measures. Our result shows that the area-under-curve value is .92 for classifying epileptic CV-PAC using CV-CNN. The area-under-curve value decreases to .89, .80, and .88 while using traditional convolutional neural networks, support vector machine, and random forest, respectively. The phases of delta (1–4 Hz) and alpha (8–10 Hz) bands are different between epileptic and normal CV-PAC. The phase information of CV-PAC is important for improving classification performance. The proposed approach of CV-PAC/CV-CNN promises to identify more accurate epileptic brain activities for potential surgical intervention.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) extracted from interictal ECoG and the feasibility of PAC serving as a promising biomarker for SOZ identification. We employed the mean vector length modulation index approach on the 20-s ECoG window to calculate PAC features between low-frequency rhythms (0.5–24 Hz) and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) (80–560 Hz). We used statistical measures to test the significant difference in PAC between the SOZ and non-seizure onset zone (NSOZ). To overcome the drawback of handcraft feature engineering, we established novel machine learning models to learn automatically the characteristics of the obtained PAC features and classify them to identify the SOZ. Besides, to handle imbalanced dataset classification, we introduced novel feature-wise/class-wise re-weighting strategies in conjunction with classifiers. In addition, we proposed a time-series nest cross-validation to provide more accurate and unbiased evaluations for this model. Seven patients with focal cortical dysplasia were included in this study. The experiment results not only showed that a significant coupling at band pairs of slow waves and HFOs exists in the SOZ when compared with the NSOZ, but also indicated the effectiveness of the PAC features and the proposed models in achieving better classification performance .},

	abstract = {Objective
High-frequency activities (HFAs) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) are key neurophysiological biomarkers for studying human epilepsy. We aimed to clarify and visualize how HFAs are modulated by the phase of low-frequency bands during seizures.
Methods
We used intracranial electrodes to record seizures of focal epilepsy (12 focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and three focal-aware seizures in seven patients). The synchronization index, representing PAC, was used to analyze the coupling between the amplitude of ripples (80–250 Hz) and the phase of lower frequencies. We created a video in which the intracranial electrode contacts were scaled linearly to the power changes of ripple.
Results
The main low frequency band modulating ictal-ripple activities was the θ band (4–8 Hz), and after completion of ictal-ripple burst, δ (1–4 Hz)-ripple PAC occurred. The ripple power increased simultaneously with rhythmic fluctuations from the seizure onset zone, and spread to other regions.
Conclusions
Ripple activities during seizure evolution were modulated by the θ phase. The PAC phenomenon was visualized as rhythmic fluctuations.
Significance
Ripple power associated with seizure evolution increased and spread with fluctuations. The θ oscillations related to the fluctuations might represent the common neurophysiological processing involved in seizure generation.},

Oscillatory activity below this frequency range has been shown to be modulated by phase of lower frequency oscillations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that dynamic cross-frequency interactions involving pHFOs are concentrated within the epileptogenic cortex. Intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from 17 children with medically-intractable epilepsy secondary to focal cortical dysplasia were obtained. A time-resolved analysis was performed to determine topographic concentrations and dynamic changes in cross-frequency amplitude-to-phase coupling (CFC). CFC between pHFOs and the phase of theta and alpha rhythms was found to be significantly elevated in the seizure-onset zone compared to non-epileptic regions (p{\textless}0.01). Data simulations showed that elevated CFC could not be attributed to the presence of sharp transients or other signal properties. The phase of low frequency oscillations at which pHFO amplitudes were maximal was inconsistent at seizure initiation, yet consistently at the trough of the low frequency rhythm at seizure termination. Amplitudes of pHFOs were most significantly modulated by the phase of alpha-band oscillations (p{\textless}0.01). These results suggest that increased CFC between pHFO amplitude and alpha phase may constitute a marker of epileptogenic brain areas and may be relevant for understanding seizure dynamics.},

We report that both ripples and fast ripples exhibit a preferred phase angle of coupling with the trough-peak (or On-Off) state transition of the sleep slow wave in the hippocampal seizure onset zone (SOZ). Ripples on slow waves in the hippocampal SOZ also had a lower power, greater spectral frequency, and shorter duration than those in the non-SOZ. Slow waves in the mesial temporal lobe modulated the baseline firing rate of excitatory neurons, but did not significantly influence the increased firing rate associated with ripples. In summary, pathological ripples and fast ripples occur preferentially during the On-Off state transition of the slow wave in the epileptogenic hippocampus, and ripples do not require the increased recruitment of excitatory neurons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

High-frequency activities (HFAs) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) are key neurophysiological biomarkers for studying human epilepsy. We aimed to clarify and visualize how HFAs are modulated by the phase of low-frequency bands during seizures.
Methods
We used intracranial electrodes to record seizures of focal epilepsy (12 focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures and three focal-aware seizures in seven patients). The synchronization index, representing PAC, was used to analyze the coupling between the amplitude of ripples (80–250 Hz) and the phase of lower frequencies. We created a video in which the intracranial electrode contacts were scaled linearly to the power changes of ripple.
Results
The main low frequency band modulating ictal-ripple activities was the θ band (4–8 Hz), and after completion of ictal-ripple burst, δ (1–4 Hz)-ripple PAC occurred. The ripple power increased simultaneously with rhythmic fluctuations from the seizure onset zone, and spread to other regions.
Conclusions
Ripple activities during seizure evolution were modulated by the θ phase. The PAC phenomenon was visualized as rhythmic fluctuations.
Significance
Ripple power associated with seizure evolution increased and spread with fluctuations. The θ oscillations related to the fluctuations might represent the common neurophysiological processing involved in seizure generation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The interactions between different EEG frequency bands have been widely investigated in normal and pathologic brain activity. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is one of the important forms of this interaction where the amplitude of higher frequency oscillations is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Here, we studied the dynamic variations of PAC of high (gamma and ripple) and low (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) frequency bands in patients with focal epilepsy in different sleep stages during the interictal period, in an attempt to see if coupling is different in more or less epileptogenic regions. Sharp activities were excluded to avoid their effect on the PAC. The results revealed that the coupling intensity was generally the highest in stage N3 of sleep and the lowest in rapid eye movement sleep. We also compared the coupling strength in different regions [seizure onset zone (SOZ), exclusively irritative zone, and normal zone]. PAC between high and low frequency rhythms was found to be significantly stronger in the SOZ compared to normal regions. Also, the coupling was generally more elevated in spiking channels outside the SOZ than in normal regions. We also examined how the power in the delta band correlates to the PAC, and found a mild but statistically significant correlation between slower background activity in epileptic channels and the elevated coupling in these channels. The results suggest that an elevated PAC may reflect some fundamental abnormality, even after exclusion of sharp activities and even in the interictal period. PAC may therefore contribute to understanding the underlying dynamics of epileptogenic brain regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Brain rhythms dynamics in general, and phase-amplitude coupling in particular, are known to be drastically altered during epileptic seizures. However, the neural processes that take place before a seizure are not well understood. We analysed the phase-amplitude coupling dynamics of stereoelectroencephalography recordings (30 seizures, 5 patients) before and after seizure onset. Electrodes near the seizure onset zone showed higher phase-amplitude coupling. Immediately before the beginning of the seizure, phase-amplitude coupling dropped to values similar to the observed in electrodes far from the seizure onset zone. Thus, our results bring accurate information to detect epileptic events during pre-ictal periods and to delimit the zone of seizure onset in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.},

We evaluated the use of phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) of iEEG signals over a period of 24 h to detect the ictal and interictal states. PAC was estimated by using a synchronisation index (SI) for iEEG signals from seven patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. iEEG signals of the ictal state was characterised by a strong PAC between the phase of β and the amplitude of high γ. Furthermore, using SI values, the ictal state was successfully detected with significantly higher accuracy than by using the amplitude of high γ alone. In conclusion, PAC accurately distinguished the ictal state from the interictal state.},

	abstract = {Objective
Neural activity of the epileptic human brain contains low- and high-frequency oscillations in different frequency bands, some of which have been used as reliable biomarkers of the epileptogenic brain areas. However, the relationship between the low- and high-frequency oscillations in different cortical areas during the period from pre-seizure to post-seizure has not been completely clarified.
Methods
We recorded electrocorticogram data from the temporal lobe and hippocampus of seven patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The modulation index based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and the phase-amplitude coupling co-modulogram were adopted to quantify the coupling strength between the phase of low-frequency oscillations (0.2–10Hz) and the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations (11–400Hz) in different seizure epochs. The time-varying phase-amplitude modulogram was used to analyze the phase-amplitude coupling pattern during the entire period from pre-seizure to post-seizure in both the left and right temporal lobe and hippocampus. Channels with strong modulation index were compared with the seizure onset channels identified by the neurosurgeons and the resection channels in the clinical surgery.
Results
The phase-amplitude coupling strength (modulation index) increased significantly in the mid-seizure epoch and decrease significantly in seizure termination and post-seizure epochs (p{\textless}0.001). The strong phase-amplitude-modulating low- and high-frequency oscillations in the mid-seizure epoch were mainly δ, θ, and α oscillations and γ and ripple oscillations, respectively. The phase-amplitude modulation and strength varied among channels and was asymmetrical in the left and right temporal cortex and hippocampus. The “fall-max” phase-amplitude modulation pattern, i.e., high-frequency amplitudes were largest in the low-frequency phase range [−π, 0], which corresponded to the falling edges of low-frequency oscillations, appeared in the middle period of the seizures at epileptic focus channels. Channels with strong modulation index appeared on the corresponding left or right temporal cortex of surgical resection and overlapped with the clinical resection zones in all patients.
Conclusions
The “fall-max” pattern between the phase of low-frequency oscillation and amplitude of high-frequency oscillation that appeared in the middle period of the seizures is a reliable biomarker in epileptogenic cortical areas. The modulation index can be used as a good tool for lateralization and localization for the epileptic focus in patients with epilepsy.
Significance
Phase-amplitude coupling can provide meaningful reference for accurate resection of epileptogenic focus and provide insight into the underlying neural dynamics of the epileptic seizure in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.},

	abstract = {High frequency oscillations have been proposed as a clinically useful biomarker of seizure generating sites. We used a unique set of human microelectrode array recordings (four patients, 10 seizures), in which propagating seizure wavefronts could be readily identified, to investigate the basis of ictal high frequency activity at the cortical (subdural) surface. Sustained, repetitive transient increases in high gamma (80–150 Hz) amplitude, phase-locked to the low-frequency (1–25 Hz) ictal rhythm, correlated with strong multi-unit firing bursts synchronized across the core territory of the seizure. These repetitive high frequency oscillations were seen in recordings from subdural electrodes adjacent to the microelectrode array several seconds after seizure onset, following ictal wavefront passage. Conversely, microelectrode recordings demonstrating only low-level, heterogeneous neural firing correlated with a lack of high frequency oscillations in adjacent subdural recording sites, despite the presence of a strong low-frequency signature. Previously, we reported that this pattern indicates a failure of the seizure to invade the area, because of a feedforward inhibitory veto mechanism. Because multi-unit firing rate and high gamma amplitude are closely related, high frequency oscillations can be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish the core seizure territory from the surrounding penumbra. We developed an efficient measure to detect delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations based on cross-frequency coupling between high gamma amplitude and the low-frequency (1–25 Hz) ictal rhythm. When applied to the broader subdural recording, this measure consistently predicted the timing or failure of ictal invasion, and revealed a surprisingly small and slowly spreading seizure core surrounded by a far larger penumbral territory. Our findings thus establish an underlying neural mechanism for delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations, and provide a practical, efficient method for using them to identify the small ictal core regions. Our observations suggest that it may be possible to reduce substantially the extent of cortical resections in epilepsy surgery procedures without compromising seizure control.},
