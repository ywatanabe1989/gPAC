# VRAM Reporting Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **VRAM showing 0.0 MB**: 
   - Root cause: PAC model was being initialized with wrong parameters (`multi_gpu` and `return_as_dict` instead of `device_ids`)
   - Fixed by updating `create_pac_model()` to use correct `device_ids` parameter

2. **Unit inconsistency (MB vs GiB)**:
   - Changed all memory display units from GB to GiB for consistency
   - Updated both utils.py and vram.py

3. **Memory measurement accuracy**:
   - Added debug logging to track memory at different stages
   - Improved memory measurement by properly tracking baseline, peak, and current memory
   - Added device placement verification

## Changes Made

### utils.py
- Fixed `create_pac_model()` to use `device_ids` parameter instead of non-existent `multi_gpu`
- Added debug logging for memory tracking
- Changed memory units from GB to GiB
- Added GPU device name display in `print_gpu_info()`
- Improved memory measurement logic with better baseline tracking

### vram.py
- Changed all memory display units from GB to GiB
- Increased precision for memory display (from 1 to 2 decimal places for small values)

### TODO.md
- Marked VRAM issues as resolved with detailed notes

## Testing Recommendations

Run the vram.py script to verify:
```bash
cd examples/performance/multiple_gpus/
python vram.py
```

Expected behavior:
- Memory usage should now show actual values instead of 0.0
- All memory values displayed in GiB
- Debug output will show memory tracking at each stage
